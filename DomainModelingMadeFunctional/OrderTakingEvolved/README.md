# Example code from Domain Modeling Made Functional

This project is a working example of the code from the book ["Domain Modeling Made Functional"](https://pragprog.com/book/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional)

This project is the "evolved" version of the design, with code from chapter 13.

Note that this is *not* a fully functioning application.
Its purpose is to show how the code is assembled and organized.
