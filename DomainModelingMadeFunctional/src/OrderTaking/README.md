# Example code from Domain Modeling Made Functional

This project is a working example of the code from the book ["Domain Modeling Made Functional"](https://pragprog.com/book/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional)

This project includes the code discussed in the book, up to chapter 12.
The "evolved" version, with code from chapter 13, is available in the `OrderTakingEvolved` project.

Note that this is *not* a fully functioning application.
Its purpose is to show how the code is assembled and organized.

A fully working web site will be available at https://github.com/swlaschin/DomainModelingMadeFunctional
which will also include techniques such as using applicatives for validation that we
didn't have space to discuss the book.
